# 🎬 Movie Website UI – Netflix Inspired Frontend Clone

This project is a **Netflix-inspired UI clone** created using **HTML & CSS** for learning and practice.  
It is a part of my frontend development work during my Edureka Internship.  
This is a **static frontend-only project** with responsive layout and clean UI design.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** This is *not* the official Netflix website.  
> It is only a UI clone made for educational purposes.
